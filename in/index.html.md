In a few weeks time we'll have some interesting and useful content here.
Please keep checking back.

about the project.

If you're a web design company or a digital marketing company or anyone else
who thinks it's a good idea to cold-call people who have just registered a
domain, then don't bother wasting your time. Cold-calling is a terrible way
to find new customers and we have a strict policy of not doing business with
cold-callers.

To be clear, if we have never done business with you and you call us trying
to sell us any kind of service - you are a cold caller and you are wasting
everyone's time.

And to summarise: **DO NOT PHONE US ABOUT THIS DOMAIN**.
